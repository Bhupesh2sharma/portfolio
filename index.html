      <h5 class="card-title">About Me</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> Hello,<br>

        I'm Bhupesh, and it's my pleasure to introduce myself. I was born in sikkim.
        I did my schooling at sonamati Memorial Government Ser sec School and am now pursuing my B.Tech from
        SIKKIM INSTUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.

        My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. This is because I
        believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals. And I believe in myself
        and my hard work, and I want fulfillment in everything.

        My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering, take up a challenge in some good
        organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a renowned technical
        engineer in an organization and reach the highest level of success. My moral is never to intend to harm anyone
        on purpose.

        That's all about me. Thanks for allowing me to introduce myself.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title"><b> Why did I choosed a Computer engineering.? (Computer engineering and its future as a
          career.)</b></h4>
      <p class="card-text">
        The field of Computer Engineering is experiencing extraordinary growth today because it leads
        the development of new technologies which is also one of the most in-demand degree areas for students. One
        important facet of computer engineering education that will benefit your career advancement, involves academics
        and student enrichment (such as peer tutoring, workshops, seminars, etc.) that are specifically designed to
        supplement your same-curriculum classroom experience by providing additional guided practice, and hands-on
        opportunities to learn and grow. The world is moving to a digital world and the advancements in technology have
        been making computers so much more efficient. As a result, computer engineering has become a popular choice for
        people who want to get into job fields that are related to the ever-changing digital landscape. In this article,
        we’ll explore what computer engineering entails,
        where you can get education for that career, and how it’s been changing with the times.

      <h4><b>Who is a computer engineer?</b></h4> <br>
      A computer engineer is someone who should have a foundational knowledge in the principles of computer electronics
      and other fields. They use their expertise to design computers, computer networks, and other related equipment.

      <h4><b>Is it worth it to pursue this degree?</b></h4> <br>
      As the IT industry is constantly growing and developing, it’s predicted that more IT professionals will be needed.
      Since computer engineering requires a lot of math and science skills, it can be difficult to pursue this degree as
      an undergraduate student. However, a minor in a field that complements your major may help you get a head start on
      a career in computer engineering.

      <h4><b>What is the Future of Computer Engineering?</b></h4> <br>
      Computer engineering is an essential degree for many industries, including computer programming, hardware or
      software development, and internet-based or customer service. The field is very competitive due to the high demand
      for qualified engineers. But with a lot of motivation and perseverance, you can succeed in this field. Nowadays,
      more and more people are obtaining a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering rather than a bachelor’s degree in
      a related subject such as mathematics or physics. As a result, the job market will be very competitive. Computer
      engineers are needed in many fields, including computer programming, hardware or software development, and
      internet-based works or customer service. The field will be very competitive due to the high demand for qualified
      engineers. But with a lot of motivation and perseverance, you can succeed in this field. Computer engineers design
      computer systems, networks, and other computing-related devices. The field of computer engineering is based on
      electronic and software engineering. You need to be able to work with or troubleshoot many different technologies
      in order to succeed in this profession. If you’re interested in designing computers, or Writing codes then
      pursuing a degree in computer engineering might be the right choice for you!

      <h4><b>conclusion</b></h4> <br>

      With the demands of social media, computer engineering is one of the trending fields in engineering. Employers are
      looking for individuals who are educated in computer engineering fields because employees can either come up with
      their own ideas to work on or improve technology that already exists. This will be a field that becomes more
      important in not just India but around the world.

      Stay connected & Keep learning.
